            <b>T</b>ravel photography is one of the most intriguing ‘genres’ of the craft because it’s actually a combination
            of Landscape photography, Street Photography and (sometimes) Portrait Photography. Or if you would like it can
            be just one type! It’s the most flexible of genres. You can do a mix of different work or solely focus on one
            area — maybe you want to just capture incredible landscapes. Because of this, the following tips are designed
            to help across a variety of pursuits, you’ll find they are not aimed at one specific style here, rather a collection
            of tips that will help you out, no matter your particular goal!
        </p>
        <p>Research/location scouting</p>

        <p> One of the most important things you can do to prepare yourself can be done way before you take that first step off
            the plane. Research. Location scout. Plan. Now, for you to be visiting the country, there must have been something
            in particular that drew you there, but it’s a great idea to read a few travel guidebooks for your destination
            to see what other wonders are available to you. At the very least, check out Lonely Planet for the kind of things
            that you might miss otherwise. (They also have some great books for choosing your next destination.) Maybe you
            know someone who has already visited and you could chat with them and if not then the internet is a big place!
            Read blog posts and articles to give you a rough idea of what you can expect. 5 mistakes new photographers make
            and how to avoid them. Photography is a lot of fun and a great hobby to start but there’s a lot to learn when
            you first pick up a camera. When… medium.com Once you know of a few locations you’d like to visit, see if there
            are any rules around photography for that location. Honestly, it’s a good idea to check out the different photography
            laws of the country you are visiting too. For example just because street photography is legal where you live,
            it may not be or may have various limitations in another country. Often these will relate to how you can make
            money from these photographs. Once you know what you want to shoot, it’s a good idea to check out photos that
            already exist of the place. Check out Instagram or even just Google Images. But be wary just in case these pre-existing
            images influence you too heavily. No-one wants to see the same photograph again and again. Now ask yourself the
            following questions; Are these locations easily accessible and how long will it take? Are there any time restrictions
            for opening times? What’s the weather going to be like? What time of day would be best? (think light!) Sometimes
            you can just head out and explore but plan those key locations and shots, and you will fit much more into your
            trip. It’s all about maximising the time that you have available to you!
        </p>
        <p>Ditch the map by Paul Gilmore on Unsplash So yeah — sometimes you can just head out and explore! You’ve put together
            your location list, checked out example photos on Instagram and Google Images, but part of the fun with travel
            photography is just walking out of the door without a plan, camera in hand, and see what you can find! Get yourself
            off the beaten path and explore! Get lost! It’s all very well and good planning every moment of your trip, but
            if you rely too heavily on someone else’s information, you might just find that you end up with the same standard
            images that everyone takes. That’s definitely not what you want! Who knows what’s around the corner? “The Road
            goes ever on and on Down from the door where it began. Now far ahead the Road has gone, And I must follow, if
            I can, Pursuing it with eager feet, Until it joins some larger way Where many paths and errands meet. And whither
            then? I cannot say” ― J.R.R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring Just be sure to be safe, don’t go wandering
            into dangerous places and always have a fully charged phone in case you need to access maps or phone a registered
            taxi! Get up, get out, get after it!</p>

        <p>by Arthur Savary on Unsplash I love to get up early, but it wasn’t always that way! I had to force myself to love
            it. But when I go on a trip, I thank my lucky stars because this helps me to get out of my accommodation, camera
            in hand before everyone else has spilled out onto the streets. Fewer tourists are ambling about not to mention
            the locals. Getting out early gives you that time to adjust without the hustle and bustle. If you head to one
            of the locations you researched above, then you might even have the place to yourself! But the most significant
            benefit of getting yourself out of bed and out of the door early is to take advantage of that soft, ethereal
            morning light. Ah, Golden Hour… by Jason Leung on Unsplash Now early morning isn’t the only golden hour of the
            day to get excellent natural light, dusk is pretty great too, but combined with the act of getting up and after
            it as early as possible there’s no competition in my eyes. The quality of light will also be determined by temperature,
            climate and season, so you’re sure to get a different result day by day. You could also venture out in Blue Hour,
            the hour after sunset. This is great for ‘faking’ night shots. The street lights are on, but there is still enough
            ambient light to work with. Set time aside for photography For most people travel photography comes as part of
            a holiday, whether it be with your partner or even a full-blown family holiday and so it can be difficult to
            set time aside specifically for photography. It can be challenging to fit photography in amongst the list of
            things that other people want to do but try your best to set some time aside just for photography. You might
            even find that you’d benefit from that early morning walk here too — everyone else may still be asleep! Break
            off on your own for a little while to go and shoot the images you want. My House in Budapest My hidden treasure
            chest medium.com On the flip side, I understand that this isn’t always possible so instead, you can carry on
            about your holiday and just always have your camera in hand ready to shoot. When I travel with my partner, I
            am lucky enough that she is understanding and actively encourages me to shoot, but I would still like to make
            sure she actually enjoys the trip. Because of this we often wander wherever she would like and I just have one
            camera in hand at all times to practice my street photography! Those are my four tips for travel photography
            but what about yours? Where was the best place you have ever travelled to?</p>
